# KNOWN ISSUES
================================================

## annotations

annotations don't save after absticks=0.


## changing instrument on one song affects other songs using defaults

editing one song, changing its instrument, and going over to
edit another song may result in keeping the instrument from the
previous song.  don't panic, just quit and restart program.
this happens if your next song doesn't specify the instrument;
you can work around this by setting "i piano" on the command line,
or whatever instrument you like, for your song.


## switching time signatures

can do a little weird things with how the measure ticks
are displayed (and subdivisions).



# KNOWN ISSUES WHICH ARE PROBABLY FIXED
================================================

## copy/pasting

bug in deleting, sometimes note off/on gets left behind,
and a weird gray note stretches up across the screen.
your song will soon meet its doom, don't attempt to save (?).
sorry if this ruins your groovin'.  let me know how to replicate.

UPDATE:
I think this is fixed.  
needed to "carveoutregion" with a little extra EDITnotespace
when adding notes without violent paste.


## choosing difficulty in play mode is wonky

Need to grab only midi files from piece directory.

UPDATE:
also probably fixed.  in 'getpiecesettings', needed to look for .mid files only.



# POSSIBLE BUGS (NEED INVESTIGATION)
================================================

Players switching from insert mode to nav mode without having
finished playing a note on their midi instrument.



# EXTENDING CODE WITH MORE FEATURES
================================================
roughly in order of when i'm interested in doing them

## reverse

r:  reverse note selection (in time)
R:  reverse note selection (left to right)


## search help box

ctrl+/  -   search help box


## quick-insert (q)

in select mode, where a visual block is highlighted (notes > 5):
q, will give a quick prompt, asks for key.
    C7 = major C with 7.  C E G B
    c7 = minor C with 7.  C Eb G B
    G = G chord = G B D
    etc.
then it will add in those notes in that selection.

you can also augment:
    C/  = ascending arpeggio in C major
    C// = two ascending arpeggios, back to back
    C\  = descending arpeggio
    C/\ = ascend and descend
    C~  = random arpeggio
arpeggio's will include notes of the current note-length.


## make cursor able to have a nonzero y value

so that you can see what's immediately behind you.
will need to change currentabsoluteticks to cursorabsoluteticks
in a variety of spots (not everywhere)


## scale:

command mode
scale selected notes by some factor


## metapiece

make editting difficulties possible


## loading a song

maybe:
no "edit choice menu" -- make player load from ddr-edit command line.


## helpful stuff for play mode:

notes off screen to the left/right of your current view,
on the current line.
- flashing arrows appear on the side(s) you should look into.

shift center of play for notes that are coming down from off-screen
if they exist on both sides, shrink keyboard

points for playing in non-sandbox mode


## background music

load an image for the piece (if one exists)

allow background music (.ogg files), synch with midi track.
BGmusic = X.ogg
STARTBGmusic = X # start the BG music X milli-seconds after the midi track starts.
                 #  - negative numbers are milli-seconds before the midi track stars
                 #  - positive numbers are after the midi track starts




## commands

v (set velocity)
vg (set velocity gradient) - need a cursor selection going

namem X               - names/renames the current measure as X.  fails if X is not unique.
set playerstart X     - X = True or False only.  global variable, independent of location.
add playertrack       - add this track to allowed player tracks 

edit Difficulty X     - switch over to editting the PlayerTrack for difficulty X
d X                   - shorthand for "edit Difficulty X"
transpose X           - transpose all non-drum tracks and difficulties by X, an integer 

SEARCH AND REPLACE    MOVING NOTES AROUND IF THEY ARE ON
the following commands keep the duration of a note, but move it around, or change it into
a chord, depending on what you tell it!
s/G3/G#3/l            - set G3 to G#3 on this line (l = line/local)
s/G3/G#3/g            - set G3 to G#3 everywhere (g = global)
s/G/G#/l              - similar to s/G3/G#3/l, but does it in every octave
s/G/G#/g              - similar to s/G3/G#3/g, but does it in every octave
s/G/A+/l              - set every G on this line to the A in the octave above it.
s/G/A-/g              - set every G to the A in the octave below it, everywhere
NOTE THAT THE OCTAVES ARE DEFINED AS STARTING FROM THE FIRST NOTE GIVEN in the REPLACE SECTION.
s/B/D/g               - therefore moves every B up 3 semitones to D. 
s/GBD-/GBD/g          - moves the III to the I, or whatever that is technically speaking,
                        and the G stays in the same position
s/DB-F#/DF#B/g        - moves a minor I to the III, and D stays put
s/BDF#/DF#B+/g        - moves a minor I to the III, D stays put.
s/BDF#/DF#B/g         - does nothing
s/B/DF#/l             - replaces any B in the current line with a D and F# 
EVEN MORE INTENSE
so "s/X/Y/q" should do what's intended when X is a single note.
however, if X is a chord, then the replacement will only happen if all notes in the chord
share the same length and start at the same time.  
To be more aggressive, use a capital S, i.e. "S/X/Y/q".  This command
will then execute as long as the notes in the chord X are all on at the same instant,
regardless of when each individual note begins or ends.
You can also use selections to change notes:
COMMAND               RESULT
s/G/A/v               - set every G which is completely selected in a visual block to A
s/G/A/V               - set every G which is even partially selected in a visual block to A
JUST PLAIN SEARCH.  without replacing, you can look for chords/notes via
s/GAB                 - find the next-occuring chord GAB, if it exists...


## navigation


THINGS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.  MAYBE NEVER WILL, OR WILL CHANGE KEYS.
press u for undo, U for redo
(save copies of the piece in a folder.)

press t to trim any notes which are currently under the cursor:
  - rounds to the nearest nonzero multiple of Duration,
  - and also moves its start-point again to the nearest multiple of Duration
press T to trim as above, but to delete any notes which would round down to zero.




# REFACTORING CODE
================================================

## make a class which combines commands with their history

for both search functionality and command mode
